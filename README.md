## Decision trees are mainly classification and regression types.

- Classification means the Y variable is a factor and regression type means the Y variable is numeric. Just look at one of the examples from each type,

The classification example is detecting email spam data and the regression tree example is from Boston housing data.

## Decision trees are also called Trees and CART.

- CART indicates classification and regression trees.

- The main goal behind the classification tree is to classify or predict an outcome based on a set of predictors.


## Advantageous of Decision Trees
- Easy Interpretation

- Making predictions is fast

- Easy to identify important variables

- Handless missing data

- One of the drawbacks is to can have high variability in performance.

- Recursive portioning- basis can achieve maximum homogeneity within the new partition.
